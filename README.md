# Barcelona Summer School in Demography, 2021
## Module 2 "Demography with R"

5-9 July, 2021

In this module we stress basic demographic constructs and thinking, including basic summary measures, age standardization, weighting, the Lexis diagram and how rates and probabilities relate to it, lifetables, standardization, demographic decomposition, different approximations of population growth and Leslie matrix, stationary and stable populations, projections and forecasting.

All of the material of this module was originally prepared by [Marie-Pier Bergeron-Boucher](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/forskningsenheder/samf/cpop/about_the_centre/our_people/cpop_dem/marie_pier_bergeron_boucher). This version of the course was reworked almost entirely using the tidyverse. All materials are in Rmarkdown and their built pdfs. This repository should be fairly self-sufficient, however we at times rely on pull data live from the HMD, and that part will likely break in the next year or two due to forthcoming changes to the HMD. The course also imparts a lot of tidy data wrangling.
